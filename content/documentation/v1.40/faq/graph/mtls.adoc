Sometimes the Kiali Graph Security Display option causes confusion. The option is disabled by default
for optimal performance, but enabling the option typically adds nominal time to the graph rendering. When
enabled, Kiali will determine the percentage of mutual TLS (mTLS) traffic on each edge. Kiali will only
show lock icons on edges with traffic for edges that have > 0% mTLS traffic.

Kiali determines the mTLS percentage for the edges via the `connection_security_policy` attribute in the
Prometheus telemetry. Note that this is destination telemetry (i.e. `reporter="destination"`).
