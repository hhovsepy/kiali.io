title: Why is the Workload / Application detail page so slow or not responding?

We have identified a performance issue that happens while visiting the Workload or Application detail page, related to discovering metrics in order to show custom dashboards. This issue was originally reported link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali/issues/3660[here] and is now tracked link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali/issues/3704[there].

To summarize, Kiali might be very slow to fetch some metrics from Prometheus, it might even run out of memory, and so does Prometheus.

The immediate workaround you can take in that situation is to disable dashboards discovery from config:

```yaml
  external_services:
    custom_dashboards:
      discovery_enabled: "false"
```

But we would also recommend that you consider a more robust setup for Prometheus, like the one described link:https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/best-practices/observability/#using-prometheus-for-production-scale-monitoring[in this Istio guide] (see also this link:https://medium.com/kialiproject/kiali-with-production-scale-prometheus-c53ddfa20570[Kiali blog post]), in order to decrease the metrics cardinality.

As explained in link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali/issues/3704[the tracking issue], a modification of the Prometheus API should soon be available and, hopefully, would allow Kiali to get what it needs at a much lower cost.
