Private clusters have higher network restrictions. Kiali needs your cluster to allow `TCP` traffic between the Kubernetes API service and the Istio Control Plane namespace, for both the `8080` and `15000` ports. This is required for features such as Health and Envoy Dump to work as expected.

Make sure that the firewalls in your cluster allow the connections mentioned above.

Check section Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Private Cluster requirements in the link:{{< relref "../../installation-guide/prerequisites#google-prereqs" >}}[Installation Guide, window="_blank"].
