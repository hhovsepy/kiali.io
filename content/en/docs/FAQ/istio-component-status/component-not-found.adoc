The first thing you should do is check into the Kiali CR for the `istio.component_status` field.

Kiali looks for a Deployment for which its pods have the `app` label with the specified value in the CR, and lives in that namespace.
The `app` label name may be changed from the default (app) and it is specified in the `istio_labels.app_label_name` in the https://github.com/kiali/kiali-operator/blob/master/deploy/kiali/kiali_cr.yaml[Kiali CR].

Ensure that you have specified correctly the namespace and that the deployment's pod template has the specified label.
