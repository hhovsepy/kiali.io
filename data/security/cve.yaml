# The Reported Kiali CVEs for which Kiali is confirmed to not be vulnerable
versionRange:
  - cve: "CVE-2024-33599"
    severity: high
    description: "nscd: Stack-based buffer overflow in netgroup cache If the Name Service Cache Daemon's (nscd) fixed size cache is exhausted by client requests then a subsequent client request for netgroup data may result in a stack-based buffer overflow"
    notes: "Kiali is not affected. As per the CVE description (see https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33599), this vulnerability is only present in the nscd binary. The Kiali Server image does not have this binary; run this command to confirm: podman run --user root  -it --rm --entrypoint '' quay.io/kiali/kiali:v2.2.0 ls -R / | grep nscd"
  - cve: "CVE-2024-2961"
    severity: n/a
    description: "The iconv() function in the GNU C Library versions 2.39 and older may overflow the output buffer passed to it by up to 4 bytes when converting strings to the ISO-2022-CN-EXT character set"
    notes: "Kiali is not affected. ISO-2022-CN-EXT has been removed. To confirm, run the validation command `podman run -it --rm --entrypoint '' quay.io/kiali/kiali:v2.2.0 iconv -l | grep -E 'CN-?EXT'`. See https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-2961"
  - cve: "CVE-2023-37920"
    severity: low
    description: "A flaw was found in the python-certifi package. This issue occurs when the e-Tugra root certificate in Certifi is removed, resulting in an unspecified error that has an unknown impact and attack vector."
    notes: "Kiali is not affected. This was fixed in RHEL9 base images with RHBA-2024:5691. Per the CVE page, these certs are included and marked as 'don't trust', but will not be removed until Mozilla removes them. Browsers are most at risk, which already understand and parse 'don't trust after'. Furthermore, note that Microsoft has not removed the certificate from their code-signing CA list that are merged with Mozilla's CA list, so the certificate is still there marked as trusted for code signing. See: https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-37920 and https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2024:5691"
  - cve: "CVE-2022-27191"
    severity: high
    description: "golang.org/x/crypto/ssh allows an attacker to crash a server in certain circumstances involving AddHostKey"
    notes: "Kiali does not use the AddHostKey API; furthermore, neither Kiali nor its dependencies import this component. Thus Kiali is not susceptible to this vulnerability."
  - cve: "CVE-2022-1996"
    severity: critical
    description: "github.com/emicklei/go-restful"
    notes: "Despite the package dependency Kiali is not susceptible to this vulnerability"
  - cve: "CVE-2019-1010022"
    severity: critical
    description: "GNU Libc current is affected by: Mitigation bypass."
    notes: "This is a disputed CVE. According to upstream, it is not a security issue. For details, please see https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=22850 and https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-1010022"
